Build a full-stack **Property Management** web app that uses **PostgreSQL** as the main database.

Name of the project: **SwiftNest**

🏗 Tech stack (very important):
- Backend: Node.js + Express (TypeScript preferred)
- Frontend: React (Vite or Next.js, whichever you support best)
- Database: **PostgreSQL**
- ORM: Prisma (or another good Node.js ORM) configured for PostgreSQL
- Auth: JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens) or secure session-based auth

🧩 Core Features:

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - User can register and log in.
   - During registration, user must choose **Account Type**:
     - **Individual**
     - **Organization**
   - Common fields:
     - Full name
     - Email (unique)
     - Phone
     - Password (hashed, never stored in plain text)
   - Extra fields for **Organization**:
     - Organization name
     - Organization type (e.g. Builder, Property Manager, Company, etc.)
     - GST / tax ID (optional)
   - Store account type in the database (e.g. enum: `INDIVIDUAL`, `ORGANIZATION`).

2. **Database Models (PostgreSQL)**
   - `User`
     - id (primary key)
     - name
     - email (unique)
     - phone
     - password_hash
     - account_type (`INDIVIDUAL` or `ORGANIZATION`)
     - created_at, updated_at
   - `Property`
     - id (primary key)
     - owner_user_id (FK to User.id)
     - optional: owner_org_name (for organization accounts, duplicate of org name for easy reading)
     - name (e.g. "Shree Residency", "Green Villa 101")
     - property_type (e.g. APARTMENT, VILLA, PLOT, OFFICE, SHOP — can be enum or text)
     - address_line1
     - address_line2
     - city
     - state
     - country
     - pincode
     - latitude, longitude (optional)
     - created_at, updated_at
   - (Optional but preferred) `Unit`
     - id
     - property_id (FK)
     - unit_name / number (e.g. "A-101", "Plot 23")
     - floor (optional)
     - area_sq_ft (optional)
     - status (e.g. VACANT, OCCUPIED)

   Use proper foreign keys and indexes in PostgreSQL.

3. **Property Management Features**
   - After login, show a dashboard:
     - For **Individual**: list of properties they own/added.
     - For **Organization**: list of properties under the organization account.
   - CRUD for `Property`:
     - Create a property (form with name, type, address, etc.).
     - Edit property.
     - Delete property (soft delete if possible).
     - View property details page.
   - (Optional) CRUD for `Unit` within a property.

4. **API Design**
   - Implement REST API endpoints (JSON) such as:
     - `POST /api/auth/register`
     - `POST /api/auth/login`
     - `GET /api/me` (get logged-in user)
     - `GET /api/properties`
     - `POST /api/properties`
     - `GET /api/properties/:id`
     - `PUT /api/properties/:id`
     - `DELETE /api/properties/:id`
   - Protect property routes so only authenticated users can access them.
   - Only allow users to access their own properties.

5. **Frontend UI**
   - Simple, clean, responsive layout.
   - Pages:
     - Login
     - Register (with toggle/radio: Individual vs Organization, show extra fields dynamically)
     - Dashboard: table/list of properties.
     - Add/Edit Property form.
     - Property details page showing full address and units (if units are implemented).
   - Use client-side form validation and show nice error messages from the backend.

6. **PostgreSQL Setup**
   - Use a single PostgreSQL database.
   - Provide migration files or Prisma schema migrations.
   - Configuration:
     - Read database URL from `.env` as `DATABASE_URL`.
   - Include a script or instructions to run migrations and start the app.

7. **Developer Experience**
   - Provide a clear `README` with:
     - How to set up `.env` (especially PostgreSQL connection string).
     - How to run migrations.
     - How to start backend and frontend.
   - Add a small seed script to create:
     - One individual user with sample property.
     - One organization user with sample property.
   - Use sensible error handling and return structured error JSON.

Make sure the generated project is runnable on Replit with minimal configuration: one command to start the app, PostgreSQL integration, and working registration -> login -> add property flow.
