✅ PROPERTY MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT – Processes & Functions

⸻

1. CORE PROCESSES

These define how information flows from property → system → maintenance team → completion.

⸻

1.1 Property Registration Process

Purpose: Identify, categorize, and manage each property under the system.

Key Steps:
	1.	Add property details (location, size, owner, building type).
	2.	Upload utility information (electricity, water, AC units, plumbing layout, etc.).
	3.	Add inventory:
	•	Appliances (fridge, stove, AC)
	•	Structural elements (roofing type, flooring, etc.)
	4.	Set maintenance intervals (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual).

⸻

1.2 Issue Reporting Process

Triggered when a tenant, caretaker, or system detects a fault.

Sources of reported issues:
	•	Tenant service request
	•	Periodic inspection
	•	System-triggered reminder (e.g., AC filter replacement)
	•	Staff input

Captured Information:
	•	Property
	•	Category (Electrical, Plumbing, AC, Structural, Cleaning, Pest Control)
	•	Severity level
	•	Photos/videos
	•	Recommended action

⸻

1.3 Maintenance Scheduling Process

System auto-generates tasks based on:
	•	Recurring schedules
	•	Reported issues
	•	Warranty expiry reminders
	•	Seasonal maintenance
	•	Government compliance checks

System decides:
	•	Urgency
	•	Who to assign
	•	Due dates
	•	Material requirements

⸻

1.4 Task Assignment & Execution Process

Once a task is generated:
	1.	Assign to staff/contractor
	2.	Notify assigned user
	3.	Worker accepts/rejects
	4.	Work begins
	5.	Upload progress photos
	6.	Submit for supervisor verification
	7.	Supervisor approves & closes task

⸻

1.5 Quality Control & Follow-up

After task completion:
	•	QC checklist
	•	Next maintenance date updated
	•	Costs logged
	•	Warranty resets if applicable

⸻

2. SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

These are the actual features your system should provide.

⸻

2.1 Property Functions
	•	Add/Edit/Delete property
	•	Upload documents (plans, warranties, receipts)
	•	Auto-generate maintenance calendar
	•	View property maintenance history

⸻

2.2 Task Management Functions
	•	Generate tasks (manual & automated)
	•	Assign tasks to a user/unit
	•	Set due dates, priority
	•	Track progress
	•	Attach photos, materials used
	•	Close/approve tasks
	•	Reopen incomplete tasks

⸻

2.3 Team/User Management
	•	Create users: Supervisor, Technician, Cleaner, Contractor
	•	Assign skill categories (AC, plumbing, electrical)
	•	Limit tasks users can accept based on skill
	•	Track task efficiency per user

⸻

2.4 Notifications & Alerts
	•	Task assigned
	•	Task overdue
	•	Maintenance upcoming
	•	Material shortages
	•	Tenant emergency requests

⸻

2.5 Inventory & Material Tracking
	•	Material database
	•	Auto-deduct when used in tasks
	•	Low stock alerts
	•	Link to Noblecon inventory for material procurement

⸻

2.6 Reporting Functions
	•	Property-wise maintenance cost
	•	Staff performance
	•	Most common issues
	•	Preventive vs. reactive tasks
	•	Monthly maintenance summary

⸻

3. TASK GENERATION LOGIC

This defines how and when tasks are created.

⸻

3.1 Recurring Tasks

Examples:

Category	Frequency	Task
AC	Quarterly	AC filter cleaning
Plumbing	Monthly	Check leaks & water pressure
Electrical	Semi-annual	Distribution board tightening
Pest Control	Quarterly	General pest treatment
Cleaning	Weekly/Monthly	Deep cleaning

System automatically generates the next task after closing the current one.

⸻

3.2 Conditional Tasks (Based on Triggers)

Trigger Examples
	•	AC temperature sensor detects abnormal readings
	•	Water pump running > normal duration
	•	Tenant reports issue through portal
	•	Last maintenance exceeded expected lifespan
	•	Warranty about to expire

System uses logic such as:

IF issue_severity = "High" THEN assign immediately  
ELSE IF due_date < 3 days AND status != completed THEN escalate  


⸻

3.3 Manual Tasks

Supervisor can manually add tasks:
	•	Renovation
	•	Painting
	•	Special cleaning
	•	New installation
	•	Emergency repair

⸻

4. TASK ASSIGNMENT WORKFLOW

⸻

4.1 Assignment Rules

Assignment based on:
	•	Skill category
	•	Availability
	•	Location proximity
	•	Task priority

Example Workflow
	1.	New AC task created → System filters AC technicians
	2.	Find who is free or closest
	3.	Assign
	4.	Notify: “AC Service Required – Property A – Due by 4 pm”

⸻

4.2 Escalation Rules

Escalate when:
	•	Task overdue
	•	Technician rejects multiple times
	•	Problem repeats within 7 days
	•	Tenant marks as unresolved

Escalation actions:
	•	Notify Supervisor
	•	Reassign to senior technician
	•	Increase priority to “Urgent”
	•	Optionally notify property owner
