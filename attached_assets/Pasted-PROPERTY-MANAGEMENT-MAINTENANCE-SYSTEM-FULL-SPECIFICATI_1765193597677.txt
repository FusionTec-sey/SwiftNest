1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The system is designed to manage properties end-to-end:
• Operationally: property details, inspections, maintenance tasks, inventory usage and staff
assignment.
depreciation.
• Financially: rental billing (short and long term), loan servicing, utilities, deposits, expenses, and asset
• Reporting: property-wise, owner-wise, and portfolio-wide financial and operational KPIs.
All key actions (e.g. rent invoice, loan repayment, maintenance cost) are mapped to a Chart of
Accounts and stored as ledger entries to support proper accounting and tax reporting.
2. CORE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES
2.1 Property Registration Process
• Add property details: location, size, owner(s), building type.
• Upload utility information: electricity meters, water meters, AC units, plumbing layout.
• Add inventory mapping: fixed appliances, structural elements.
• Set maintenance intervals per category (e.g. AC quarterly, plumbing monthly).
• Link property to one or more owners with ownership percentages.
2.2 Issue Reporting Process
• Issues can be created from:
– Tenant service requests
– Periodic inspections
– System-triggered alerts or reminders
– Manual staff input
• Capture for each issue:
– Property and unit
– Category (Electrical, Plumbing, AC, Structural, Cleaning, Pest Control, etc.)
– Severity (Low/Medium/High/Urgent)
– Description and photos/videos
– Recommended action or trade required.
2.3 Maintenance Scheduling Process
• System generates tasks from:
– Recurring schedules (preventive maintenance)
– Logged issues
– Seasonal jobs and compliance checks
• For each new task, system determines:
– Priority and required completion date
– Skill category (AC, Electrical, Plumbing, etc.)
– Required materials (if known)
– Whether the cost is owner-borne or re-billable to tenant.
2.4 Task Assignment & Execution
• Tasks are assigned to users (internal technicians or external contractors) based on:
– Skill category
– Location/proximity
– Current workload
• Execution flow:
– Task assigned → assignee notified
– Assignee accepts/rejects
– Work in progress with status updates
– Photos and notes uploaded
– Completion submitted for supervisor review
– Supervisor approves and closes or reopens task.
2.5 Quality Control & Follow-Up
• Use QC checklists per task type (AC service, electrical checks, etc.).
• Log time taken, materials used and total cost.
• Update next scheduled maintenance date where relevant.
• For repeated issues, flag property/equipment for deeper inspection.
3. SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
3.1 Property Functions
• Create, edit, deactivate properties and units.
• Store and view documents: plans, warranties, insurance, contracts.
• Auto-generate a property maintenance calendar.
• View full maintenance and financial history for each property.
3.2 Task & To-Do Management
• Create tasks manually or auto-generate from schedules/issues.
• Set priority, due date, and category.
• Assign tasks to users or teams.
• Track task status (Pending, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled).
• Upload photos, documents, comments and materials used.
• Reopen tasks if QC fails or tenant marks unresolved.
3.3 Team & User Management
• User roles: Admin, Supervisor, Technician, Cleaner, Contractor, Accountant, Owner.
• Skillsets per user (AC, plumbing, electrical, carpentry, multi-trade).
• Track utilization and performance (tasks completed, rework, response time).
3.4 Notifications & Alerts
• New task assignment.
• Tasks due soon and overdue tasks.
• Upcoming preventive maintenance.
• Low inventory alerts.
• Tenant emergency requests.
• Upcoming loan repayments and important financial deadlines.
3.5 Inventory & Materials
• Maintain items: code, description, unit, cost, stock level, preferred supplier.
• Link materials to tasks and jobs.
• Auto-deduct stock when materials are used.
• Allow purchase orders and goods received notes (optional phase).
• Support costing of jobs and capital improvements.
3.6 Reporting Functions
• Operational:
– Open vs completed tasks
– Average response/closure time
– Most common issue types
• Financial:
– Property-wise and owner-wise P&L;
– Maintenance cost breakdown by category
– Utility recovery analysis (cost vs re-billed)
– Loan repayment schedules and outstanding balances
– Asset and depreciation reports.
4. TASK GENERATION & ASSIGNMENT LOGIC
4.1 Recurring Preventive Tasks
• Examples:
– AC: Quarterly filter cleaning and checks.
– Plumbing: Monthly leak and pressure checks.
– Electrical: Semi-annual distribution board tightening and safety tests.
– Pest control: Quarterly site treatment.
– Cleaning: Weekly or monthly deep-clean routines.
• When a task is completed, the next occurrence is automatically scheduled based on the defined
interval.
4.2 Conditional Tasks (Triggers)
• Trigger sources:
– Sensor alerts (e.g. temperature, pump run-time).
– Tenant-reported issues.
– Repeat failures or abnormal patterns.
– Warranty expiry notices.
• Example rule:
– If severity = High or category = “Safety”, create urgent task with same-day or next-day due date and
immediate notification to supervisor.
4.3 Manual Tasks
• Supervisors can create ad hoc tasks for:
– Renovations and upgrades.
– Painting.
– Deep cleaning.
– Capital works.
– Emergency repairs.
4.4 Assignment Rules
• Assignment is based on:
– Skill category and certifications.
– Current workload and availability.
– Proximity to property.
– Task priority.
• Escalation rules:
– If overdue beyond defined threshold, notify supervisor and optionally reassign.
– If the same issue repeats within short time, escalate to senior technician or engineer.

reduce Cash/Bank.
7.3 Cashflow & Projections
• For each future month, the system can calculate:
– Projected rent inflows (based on leases).
– Projected loan outflows (from LoanSchedule).

• DepreciationRules table defines per-category tax rates and special rules, with references to the
governing law and effective dates.
• For each period (monthly or annually), depreciation is computed:
– Book depreciation for financial statements.
